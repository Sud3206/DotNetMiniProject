The project name is "Employee Management System" and it is built using the ASP.NET MVC Core and Entity Framework with SQL server, Code First approach. It implements full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database to manage Employee information.

In this project, we are going to create an ASP.NET MVC CRUD app using Entity Framework Core and SQL Server. We will use .NET 6 MVC template in Visual Studio 2022 to create this CRUD app. This is a Model View Controller pattern which is a very famous architecture pattern in software design and is equally popular when clubbed together with the ASP.NET framework We will use Bootstrap 5 in this ASP.NET MVC website to style our pages. We will install EF Core packages and use the code-first approach to create our SQL Server database.
